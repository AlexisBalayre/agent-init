Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Invoke the `tdd` skill where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end. The project map in `AGENTS.md` names the commands; a check the project does not have is skipped, and a command you had to guess is reported as a guess.

Once done, review the diff against the spec or tickets: every acceptance criterion met, nothing built beyond them.

Commit your work to the current branch. If that branch is the trunk (the repository's default branch), create a feature branch and commit there instead.
